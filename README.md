# landingPage
This is the first project of the The Odin Project curriculum. The main goal is to do from scratch a landing page as similar as possible to the reference given. In this project we're allowed to use only HTML and CSS. So far, we're only using flexbox and other basic knowledges. 
It took me around a week to complete it. As I only had about an hour a day, I chose to do it in parts. So I divided the design into six parts: header, main text, information, quote, action button and footer. Each session I did in the stipulated time.
